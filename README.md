## Overview
The fundamental purpose of Capri is to provide the ability to define and extend classes
and namespaces in a way that is clean and easy to understand. The secondary purpose of
Capri is to provide a reusable toolset that caters to common needs.

Capri can be used as a module for node.js applications or selected features can be built
and minified for use in web applications. Capri also provides its own flavour of modules
which can be used if desired. The intention of Capri-style modules is to allow developers
to write modules that can be consumed by both server and client applications with minimal
(if any) change.

It is useful to note that a cleaner syntax can be used when developing modules for
ECMAScript 5 compliant platforms (like node.js or modern web browsers). Special property
names must otherwise be placed within quotes for compatibility with all major browsers.

The project is largely experimental, it would be interesting to see if fellow developers
find this of use!
